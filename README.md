# React Learn

This project was created as a presentation for the [React CWB Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/ReactJS-CWB/).
The objective of this repo is to show and explain a simple application with React.

It is a building with multiple apartments with multiple windows.
And we have the ability to open and close the apartment windows, as well as changing between night and day.

We also have some branches with different approaches to deal with global state management:
- [Redux](https://github.com/brunodahora/react-learn-components/tree/redux-learn)
- [Context API](https://github.com/brunodahora/react-learn-components/tree/context-api-learn)
- [Recoil.js](https://github.com/brunodahora/react-learn-components/tree/recoil-js-learn)
- [Redux Hooks](https://github.com/brunodahora/react-learn-components/tree/redux-hooks-learn)
